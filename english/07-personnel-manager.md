## Personnel manager

In the “Personnel Manager” you can manage the list of operators and their rights in the “Security Center” modules, emergency response guards which are used in the “Security Center”, and the list of local network computers where operation of network workstations of the “Security center” is permitted.

### Operators

The “Operators” tab is designed to modify the list software operators and their rights in the “Security Center” modules.

Operator rights are individual for each the “Security Center” module and depend on operations which can be executed in the module.

Prior to determination of operator rights in a module you should permit an operator to enter this module.

When creating a new operator you can give him the same rights as one of the existing operators has. To do this prior to creation of a new operator you should select from the list of operators the one whose rights you want to copy.

In the “Personnel Manager” module you may not edit a name and rights of the operator which has entered the module and the “Administrator” operator. 

Present “Personnel Manager” operator and “Administrator” operator are only allowed to change password.

### Guards

In the “Guards” you can modify the list of guards which are used in the “Security Center” software.

### Computers

The “Computers” tab is designed to manage the list of computers where operation of network workstations of the “Security Center” software and objects accessible from these computers is permitted.

By default each computer where the “Security Center” software module is started is automatically enlisted. But when limitation permitting to run network workstations of the “Security Center” only on computers which are included in the list is switched on then you should manually add computers to the list.

If it is necessary you may define for each computer the list of object numbers which are permitted to be loaded by the “Security Center” modules running in this computer.
