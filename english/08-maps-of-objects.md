## Maps of Objects

Using the “Maps of Objects” module you can create graphic schemes describing an object: a ground map with possible approach lines to an object, object photos, floor plans and so on.

Once a plan of object rooms has been developed you can place security lines scheme on it.
In alarm response mode you can access the function of viewing alarm loops on object maps in the “Duty Operator” module. 

“Maps of Objects” module does not contain built-in the graphic editor, thus we recommend you to create schemes using outside means. Ready-made images can be pasted in the map from the files of BMP or JPG format as a background picture. When you prepare background picture you should select its size and resolution with regard to possible printing the map of objects: no transformations are made, a background picture is printed according to its parameters.

Once a background picture for the map has been selected it is possible to place zones (signalization loops) on it. For each zone you can select location and dimensions as well as method of its displaying in active and inactive state. 

After this you should associate the zone with a code of event which recording will mean the zone activation. Generally, an alarm code corresponding to the zone is selected as such code.

When file of alarm object maps is opened from the “Duty Operator” module the active map is the map where the zone for which alarm has been received is located. Additionally, an alarm zone can change visually displaying alternatively in passive and active state.

Also, you can specify associated file for the zone. When file of alarm object maps is opened associated file also opens by means provided in the operational system for its file type. 

For example, if you specify a document containing important information about an object as associated file this document opens together with the map file.

If the “Security Center” software is running in network then a map file should be saved to folder readable for all network users. However you should remember that even if this folder is local for a computer where object maps are edited when you perform saving absolute path should be used.

When a new object map file is saved or when it is saved under an alternative name the “Object Map” field –its value can be viewed and changed in the “Object Manager” module -  is automatically updated.
